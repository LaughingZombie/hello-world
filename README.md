# hello-world
I don't know what this is.

Hi whoever is reading this... I actually don't know why i am here. I stumbled upon Github when i was introduced to VS Code. I am currently learning C, C++, Java, html and stuffs. I am an Undergraduate studying computer science. Although i am new to programming wolrd, i am quite impressed by what a coding is and what it can possibly do. Landing myself in this whole new environment is one of the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am loving it and I want to learn more.

LZ.
